# Google-data-analysis-
This project performs a data-driven analysis of global interest in emerging technologies using Google Trends via the PyTrends API. The focus is on topics like cloud computing, data science, and machine learning. Data is fetched dynamically and analyzed across regions and time periods. The project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize trends. Key visualizations include country-wise interest bar charts, time-series line plots, and interactive world maps. Seaborn is used for static insights while Plotly enhances interactivity with choropleth maps. Multiple keyword comparisons are conducted to assess relative popularity over the past 12 months. Common warnings like palette deprecation in Seaborn and parameter misuse in Plotly are addressed. This project offers real-time, visually rich insights into how technology topics trend globally, making it a strong addition to data science portfolios and ideal for GitHub presentation. It demonstrates practical use of APIs, data visualization, and trend interpretation.
